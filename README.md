# C++ Portfolio
This is a repository of assignments I completed for the spring semester of 2023 for one of my computer science courses


## ShellFramework.cpp
not actually in the class but I found the basic structure helpful as a side project
### Issues
  - There is an issue where if a command is supplied with spaces
    the program will output two prompts as if it recieved two
    inputs.
  - Only entering the return charicter will not return the prompt 
    again but instead drops cursor onto a blank line.
