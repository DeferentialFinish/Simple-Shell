# C++ Portfolio
This is a repository of assignments I completed for the spring semester of 2023 for one of my computer science courses. It showcases my knowledge and familiarity with the following concepts in programming:
- variuble decleration and types
- if/else statements
- switch case statements
- while loops
- custom function declerations
- input and output
- memory management in c++
- file access in c++

## PenTestersRun.cpp
Create a game about something you are passionate about. I chose pen testing and cybersecurity as my general topic and based my game around a pentester on an assignment. Very simple and clunky but the code runs. For completing this task in under a week I was able to get a suprising amount done.

### Issues
- Guard mechanics
- Could display current player location and guard location on the minimap
- Output and input can be confusing and clunky

## NIM.cpp
When supplied with a file and asked to improve the following I was able to complete the project by the deadline.
NIM improved by
		- Adding new outputs for wins and losses
		- Printing the game rules
		- adding exciting commentary
		- Removing the magic numbers
		- Printing sybols that represent the remaining objects
		- Adding a play again option
### Issues
  - No known issues


## Float_Check.cpp
Allow the user to supply a number and determine the following
 - if the number is a decimal aka floating point number
 - if the number is even or odd
### Issues
 - No known issues

## Simple_Calculator.cpp
A very simple calculator in C++ that allows the user to do the following
 - enter two numbers then an operation to be preformed on those numbers
 - detect divide by zero errors
### Issues
  - Could have looping functionality 

## Fourtune_Teller.cpp
Simple fortune teller program that uses a number provided by the user to output a fortune.

### Issues
  - Output and fortunes are kind of wierd.
  - Could use a file to print fortunes from
  - lucky number could be more randomly generated

## ShellFramework.cpp
not actually in the class but I found the basic structure helpful as a side project
### Issues
  - There is an issue where if a command is supplied with spaces
    the program will output two prompts as if it recieved two
    inputs.
  - Only entering the return charicter will not return the prompt 
    again but instead drops cursor onto a blank line.


## Disclaimer
Understand that each and every program is designed to demonstrate a concept in programming and none of this code should be used for in production purposes. The classes I took did not cover secure coding practices but was mearly an introduction to C++ as a language. It is most likely that every single program in this repository that accepts input has a buffer overflow vulnerability.
